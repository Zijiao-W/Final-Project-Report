## Question

The question of interest for this data solution was, "how does one assess a player, specifically, a batter's performance across various games?", and a metric that was chosen, as mentioned in the abstract, is xWOBA.

## Relevance of xWOBA

xWOBA is relevant to player evaluation and performance because it is a metric that covers many sub-metrics. For example, it includes in the calculation exit velocity, launch angle, and sprint speed (@xwoba). These are all key measurements to determining how well a player performs on the field. As a metric that aggregates all these things together, xWOBA manages to measure many things at once.

The other metric considered for this data solution was WOBA, which is the weighted on-base average. At the end, it was not chosen because WOBA includes defense in the calculation, but hitters and pitchers have no control over what happens to a batted ball, as described in @xwoba.

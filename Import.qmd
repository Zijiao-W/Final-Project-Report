## Import

As described in the Abstract of the index, the data set used in this project is baseballr, @rawdata, which consists of many functionalities. For this data solution in particular, the only imported data is

```{r}
library(baseballr)

main_data <- bref_daily_batter("2024-01-01", "2025-07-01")
```

The first important thing to note is that the data is from January 2024 to July of 2025. This is to make sure that the data is up to date as much as possible for stakeholders to make the right decisions. Outdated data are not as important, because player performance can vary between seasons, due to aging, the environment that they are playing in, and so on. It also narrows down the scope of the data as to make it easier to work with.

As to why this data set is chosen - it is because this data set contains the exact parameters needed to calculate xWOBA, along with other information such as player name, age, and team. As seen in Figure 3.1, the data set contains a lot of columns. For the sake of accessibility, the columns not involved in the calculation of xWOBA will not be explained. The columns that are involved will be explained in later chapters. For now, this is just a preview of the data.

This data solution also assumes that the stakeholders have a working knowledge of xWOBA - this is evident since anyone who is concerned with player performance would at least know about the metric. More specific things such as what each xWOBA value entails was given in Figure 1.1.
